# Static-website-hosting-on-aws-S3

In this repository, you'll find everything you need to get your static website up and running on Amazon's Simple Storage Service. 

We'll start by creating a new S3 bucket and configuring it for website hosting. Then we'll upload our website's files (index.html and error.html) to the bucket and set. Finally, we'll test our website to make sure it's working as expected.
